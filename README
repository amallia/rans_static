These are my derivations of Fabien 'Ryg's rANS coder plus a
static arithmetic coder derived from Eugene Shelwein's work.
Therefore none of the really complex stuff is my own and the real
credit belongs elsewhere.

The originals can be found at:
    https://github.com/rygorous/ryg_rans
    http://ctxmodel.net (defunct?)

I thought about forking this, but I didn't do that way back when I
first created my variants and so it'd be a fork in name only, with no
actual history.

The arithmetic coder was designed to be a fast unrolled variant that
coded using multiple arithmetic coders simultaneously. I also
implemented a static order-1 model in addition to the usual order-0.

About the same time I'd finished that code the ANS implementations
started arriving so I took Ryg's original rANS (two way interleaved
variant) and produced a 4-way interleaved version.  Successive
optimisations lead version "4c".  Most recently I explored some newer
tweaks and ideas.

arith_static.c
	The unrolled order-0/1 arithmetic coder.

rANS_static4c.c
	A 4-way unrolled order-0/1 rANS coder.

rANS_static4j.c
	Recent (Apr 2016) optimisations to 4c.c above.
	The output is interchangeable.

rANS_static64c.c
rans64.h
	A 4 way unrolled version of Ryg's rans64.h.
	(This needs a mulhi cpu instruction to do 64-bit by 64-bit
	multiplication and take the top 64-bits of the result.
	Available on most(all?) x86_64 architectures, but I needed to
	consider 32-bit hosts too.)

rANS_static4_16i.c
	A variant of the rANS_static4 code that uses 16-bit shifts.
	Kludgy and full of warnings. It may also not be robust!
	This is the same idea used in Ryg's SIMD variant; by keeping
	the rANS state as 16+16 instead of 24+8 we only ever have one
	normalisation step instead of two.

Sorry there's no makefile, but it's all self contained single .c files
basically.  I put these here in place of my old ftp site simply
because it's easier for people to find and discuss.

PS.
See http://encode.ru/threads/1867-Unrolling-arithmetic-coding
for the thread that started this particular ball rolling.
